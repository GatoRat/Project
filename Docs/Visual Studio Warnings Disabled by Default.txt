C4191 (level 3) 	'operator': unsafe conversion from 'type_of_expression' to 'type_required'
C4263 (level 4) 	'function': member function does not override any base class virtual member function
C4264 (level 1) 	'virtual_function': no override available for virtual member function from base 'class'; function is hidden
C4266 (level 4) 	'function': no override available for virtual member function from base 'type'; function is hidden
C4287 (level 3) 	'operator': unsigned/negative constant mismatch
C4546 (level 1) 	function call before comma missing argument list

C4355 	'this' : used in base member initializer list

C4365 (level 4) 	'action': conversion from 'type_1' to 'type_2', signed/unsigned mismatch
C4370 (level 3) 	layout of class has changed from a previous version of the compiler due to better packing
C4371 (level 3) 	'classname': layout of class may have changed from a previous version of the compiler due to better packing of member 'member'
C4388 (level 4) 	signed/unsigned mismatch

C4571 (level 4) 	informational: catch(...) semantics changed since Visual C++ 7.1; structured exceptions (SEH) are no longer caught
C4582 (level 4) 	'type': constructor is not implicitly called
C4583 (level 4) 	'type': destructor is not implicitly called
C4587 (level 1) 	'anonymous_structure': behavior change: constructor is no longer implicitly called
C4588 (level 1) 	'anonymous_structure': behavior change: destructor is no longer implicitly called
C4598 (level 1 and level 3) 	'#include "header"': header number number in the precompiled header does not match current compilation at that position
C4599 (level 3) 	'option path': command-line argument number number does not match pre-compiled header

C4605 (level 1) 	'/Dmacro' specified on current command line, but was not specified when precompiled header was built
C4619 (level 3) 	#pragma warning: there is no warning number 'number'
C4623 (level 4) 	'derived class': default constructor could not be generated because a base class default constructor is inaccessible
C4626 (level 4) 	'derived class': assignment operator could not be generated because a base class assignment operator is inaccessible
C4654 (level 4) 	Code placed before include of precompiled header line will be ignored. Add code to precompiled header.

C4826 (level 2) 	Conversion from 'type1' to 'type2' is sign-extended. This may cause unexpected runtime behavior.
C4841 (level 4) 	non-standard extension used: compound member designator used in offsetof
C4842 (level 4) 	the result of 'offsetof' applied to a type using multiple inheritance is not guaranteed to be consistent between compiler releases
C4868 (level 4) 	'file(line_number)' compiler may not enforce left-to-right evaluation order in braced initialization list

C4928 (level 1) 	illegal copy-initialization; more than one user-defined conversion has been implicitly applied
C4946 (level 1) 	reinterpret_cast used between related classes: 'class1' and 'class2'
C4986 (level 4) 	'symbol': exception specification does not match previous declaration
C4987 (level 4) 	nonstandard extension used: 'throw (...)'

C5022 	'type': multiple move constructors specified
C5023 	'type': multiple move assignment operators specified
