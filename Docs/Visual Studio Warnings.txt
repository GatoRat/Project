Turn off:

4201 // nonstandard extension used : nameless struct/union

Turn on (as errors):

4265 // class has virtual functions, but destructor is not virtual
4289 // loop control variable declared in the for-loop is used outside the for-loop scope
4296 // expression is always false
4431 // missing type specifier - int assumed.
4545 // expression before comma evaluates to a function which is missing an argument list
4547 // operator before comma has no effect; expected operator with side-effect
4548 // expression before comma has no effect; expected expression with side-effect
4549 // operator before comma has no effect; did you intend 'operator'?
4555 // expression has no effect; expected expression with side-effec
4905 // wide string literal cast to 'LPSTR'
4906 // string literal cast to 'LPWSTR'
5038 // order of initialization in initializer lists

Possibly turn on locally: (Turning these on globally will drive you crazy!)

#pragma warning(error : 4061) // enumerator 'identifier' in switch of enum 'enumeration' is not explicitly handled by a case label
#pragma warning(error : 4062) // enumerator 'identifier' in switch of enum 'enumeration' is not handled

Possibly turn off locally (in test code):

4748 // /GS can not protect parameters and local variables from local buffer overrun because optimizations are disabled in function
